# Predicting-Crop-Production-Based-on-Agricultural-Data

Problem Statement:

Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy, and accurately predicting crop production is essential for improving planning and decision-making. This project aims to develop a regression model that forecasts crop production (in tons) based on agricultural factors such as area harvested (in hectares), yield (in kg/ha), and the year, for various crops grown in a specific region
